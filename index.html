                <h2>The life of Garrett Morgan</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>1877</b> - Born in Paris, Kentucky.</li>
                    <li><b>1895</b> - Moved to Cincinnati where he worked as a handyman and later working in a swering
                        machine.</li>
                    <li><b>1907</b> - Opend a sewing machine repair shop and applied for a patent for an improved sewing
                        machine design.</li>
                    <li><b>1909</b> - Expanded to owning a large tailor shop consiting of 32 employees.</li>
                    <li><b>1914</b> - Patented a design for a safety hood (gas mask) to reduce the risk of smoke
                        inhalation.
                        This design would help protect soldiers from mustard gas during WWI.
                        He hired a white actor to pose as the inventor to market the mask.</li>
                    <li><b>1916</b> - A tunnel collapsed under Lake Erie near Cleveland.
                        Morgan and his brother put on safety hoods and pulled two survivors and four bodies from the
                        wreckage.
                        However, this caused financial difficulties.
                        It was now clear that the inventor of the safety hood was African American.</li>

                    <li><b>1943</b> - Began to lose his vision to glaucoma.
                        With the loss of vision, his inventions stopped</li>
